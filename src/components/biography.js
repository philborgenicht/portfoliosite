      <h1>My Background</h1>
      </div>
      <p>I did the traditional four year education after high school, attending Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where I studied financial accounting. I received a Bachelor's of Science Degree, but after graduating I found a job at a Best Buy, excelled at being salesperson there, and wound up sticking with it. I guess I had just chosen accounting as my major in college because of societal and family pressure but didn't actually want to pursue it as a career. I enjoyed working at Best Buy, because it was fun and I got to be around the latest technology and interact with customers on a daily basis.

      <p>After about 6 years, however, I began to realize that I wanted to make more out of my life and my career and do something that was more personally fulfilling. I knew I wanted to do something different with my life, but I wasn't exactly sure what. My brother in law, currently a senior engineer at Google, and his brother, a software engineer and bootcamp graduate, spoke to me about attending a coding program and I thought it sounded like a great idea. I researched several of the programs in the area, including Denver University's Program, Turing, and Galvanize, and Galvanize seemed to be well reviewed, well known, and affordable, so I decided to enroll.
